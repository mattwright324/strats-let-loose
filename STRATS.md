See section (I) Banned in-game actions to verify if something is allowed or not.

## Methods

1. Holding space bar - Helps you vault over walls and objects much more reliably.
2. Prone jumping - For getting on top of objects and places, especially where vaulting doesn't work.
3. Truck assist - Using a transport or supply truck to get on top of buildings easier
4. Panther assist - Using the panther tank barrel to get on top of more buildings, impractical
5. Two-person vaulting - Using another person standing on an object, vaulting on the object will put you above their head. Alternative to the truck-assist when no truck is available.
6. Exploit - Something that is likely unintended and should be patched
7. Belgian gate assist - Using a gate to get on top of objects or look over them
8. OOB/water supply drops - Dropping supplies in out of bounds areas or deep water to prevent them being destroyed. You can still use them as long as you are in range.
9. River crossing - Using a vehicle to cross a river you normally cannot
10. Drowning reset jumping - Jumping in water you drown in to reset the timer, as many times until you cross
11. Halftracks inside buildings - Some buildings allows you to drive a halftrack inside and park it, spawnable
12. Driving OOB to get around - You get 30s in the out of bounds area which is plenty to get around things
